Built with Bootstrap, jQuery, Node, and MySQL

This app will (eventually) be a social way to find workouts near you. When you're on the move you can go to a gym, but if you want to find activities where you can have fun and socialize, this is for you.

To-Do:
- User Auth
- Geo API
- Styling
- FE framework (between Vue and React)
- A lot more

Check it out below. Initial load is slow - running on Heroku's free tier(which sleeps after 30 mins) for now.
